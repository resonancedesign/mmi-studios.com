  		<h2>Who We Are</h2>
  		<p>We are artists, creators, thinkers, and doers... We are musicians, painters, programmers, and poets... We are the creators of the culture that surrounds you, we are the artistic voice behind a generation, and we are not going anywhere...</p>
  		<p>MMI Studios is by artists and for artists...</p>
  		<p>A careful cultivation and a continual nurturing of an idea originating from the over-active brain of Richard Bakos (aka Riki Rezinunts) which has merged with the creative forces of others who has crossed his path, snowballing into the online community you're at now.</p>
  		<h2>What We Do</h2>
  		<p>We blur the lines, use the angles, stay ahead of the curve, and adjust the contrast... We conceive, connect, collaborate, and contribute...</p>
  		<p>We offer an exclusive community dedicated to connecting creative professionals with other creative professionals in order to see each others ideas come to fruition...</p>
  		<p>We showcase featured projects, releases, and products that really stand out amongst our community...</p>
  		<p>We are somewhat selective about who joins the collective in that we don't just let anybody in. Our only requirement outside of standard registration information if that you must be some sort of artist or entrepreneur working in a creative field and have a means of displaying that online.</p>
  		<p>Please visit the <a href="#">registration page</a> if you would like to be a part of the collective...</p>
